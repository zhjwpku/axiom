## Code Organization

Axiom is a set of reusable and extensible components designed to be compatible
with Velox. These components are:

- SQL Parser compatible with PrestoSQL dialect.
  - top-level “sql” directory
- Logical Plan - a representation of SQL relations and expressions.
  - top-level “logical_plan” directory
- Cost-based [Optimizer](axiom/optimizer/README.md) compatible with Velox
  execution.
  - top-level “optimizer” directory
- Query Runner capable of orchestrating multi-stage Velox execution.
  - top-level “runner” directory
- Connector - an extention of Velox Connector APIs to provide functionality
  necessary for query parsing and planning.
  - top-level “connectors” directory

These components can be used to put together single-node or distributed
execution. Single-node execution can be single-threaded or multi-threaded.

An example of an end-to-end single-node system is a command line utility that
provides interactive SQL query execution against in-memory TPC-H dataset and
Hive dataset stored on local disk. The code is located in the top-level
directory “cli”. To launch, run

```
$ buck run @mode/opt axiom/cli:cli

or

$ ./axiom_sql
```

Type SQL query at the prompt, finish with a semi-colon and a newline:

```
SQL> desc nation;
ROW<column:VARCHAR,type:VARCHAR>
------------+--------
column      | type
------------+--------
n_nationkey | BIGINT
n_name      | VARCHAR
n_regionkey | BIGINT
n_comment   | VARCHAR
(4 rows in 4 batches)

SQL> select count(*) from nation;
ROW<count:BIGINT>
-----
count
-----
   25
(1 rows in 1 batches)
```

The query processing flow goes like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph p[Parser & Analyzer]
        sql["`SQL
        (PrestoSQL, SparkSQL, PostgresSQL, etc.)`"]
        df["`Dataframe
        (PySpark)`"]
        sql --> lp[Logical Plan]
        df --> lp
    end

    subgraph o[Optimizer]
        lp --> qg[Query Graph]
        qg --> plan[Physical Plan]
        plan --> velox[Velox Multi-Fragment Plan]
    end
```

SQL Parser parses the query into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then resolves names
and types to produce a Logical Plan. The Optimizer takes a Logical Plan and
produces an optimized executable multi-fragment Velox plan. Finally, LocalRunner
creates and executed Velox tasks to produce a query result.

EXPLAIN command can be used to print an optimized multi-fragment Velox plan
without executing it.

```
SQL> explain  select count(*) from nation;
Fragment 0: stage1 numWorkers=4:
-- PartitionedOutput[2][SINGLE Presto] -> count:BIGINT
  -- Aggregation[1][PARTIAL count := count()] -> count:BIGINT
    -- TableScan[0][table: nation, scale factor: 0.01] ->
       Estimate: 25 rows, 0B peak memory

Fragment 1:  numWorkers=1:
-- Aggregation[5][FINAL count := count("count")] -> count:BIGINT
  -- LocalPartition[4][GATHER] -> count:BIGINT
    -- Exchange[3][Presto] -> count:BIGINT
       Input Fragment 0
```

EXPLAIN ANALYZE command can be used to execute the query and print Velox plan
annotated with runtime statistics.

```
SQL> explain analyze select count(*) from nation;

these steps:

- `git -C velox checkout main`
- `git -C velox pull`
- `git add velox`
- Build and run tests to ensure everything works.
- Submit a PR, get it approved and merged.
